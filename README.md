# Correct the box
A simple web page that allows to correct a box in perspective.

This is a tool to work on perspective based on the [Draw a box](https://drawabox.com/) approach.

Most of the work was done by [ewiigno](https://github.com/ewiigno) in [this repository](https://github.com/ewiigno/ewiigno.github.io), see the commits.
